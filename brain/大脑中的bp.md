感觉有点标题党了.

因为现实很可能是, 大脑中没有bp的过程, 但是大脑中确实有权重的调节过程, 而且这个过程是非常复杂的

1. 分子层次, 基因表达, 蛋白质

The neural learning processes in the brain do not appear to use back propagation of error signals, so the answer would be that it doesn't.

This is surprising, because back propagation is a logical and effective algorithm. However biological neurons simply do not have an obvious way to send error signals backwards through axons,

It is possible that there is a back error propagation mechanism that hasn't been discovered yet. Some candidates are "antidromal" signals from post synaptic firing neurons, or some kind of slow biochemical process effecting protein transcription at the cell nucleus, or possibly some indirect process involving feedback projections between brain areas. But to date, no one has worked out a viable mechanism, and
