The neural learning processes in the brain do not appear to use back propagation of error signals, so the answer would be that it doesn't.

This is surprising, because back propagation is a logical and effective algorithm. However biological neurons simply do not have an obvious way to send error signals backwards through axons,

It is possible that there is a back error propagation mechanism that hasn't been discovered yet. Some candidates are "antidromal" signals from post synaptic firing neurons, or some kind of slow biochemical process effecting protein transcription at the cell nucleus, or possibly some indirect process involving feedback projections between brain areas. But to date, no one has worked out a viable mechanism, and
